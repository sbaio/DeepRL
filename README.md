# DeepRL
Reinforcement learning - MVA project

For our project for Reinforcement Learning course, we studied the use of deep neural networks to resolve RL Problems.
We used the code provided by DeepMind team, related to the Nature paper:
Mnih, V., Kavukcuoglu, K., Silver, D., Graves, A., Antonoglou, I., Wierstra, D., & Riedmiller, M. (2013). Playing atari with deep reinforcement learning. arXiv preprint arXiv:1312.5602.
